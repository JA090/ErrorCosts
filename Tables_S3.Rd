\description{
function to compute expected average total error costs of one sided t-tests given two equal groups,
at different alpha levels and at simultaneously multiple levels.
Averages are over multiple runs in which costs are randomly generated. However, the expected ratio of Type I to Type II
costs is a parameter.
#' Prevalence of true findings is modelled using both zero-mean normal distributions and dichotomous distributions of effect sizes in the research environment

Output contains Table S3.1 and Table S3.2 of the paper. (Default alphas produce (b) tables; change for (a) tables.)
Details of the computations are in the paper
