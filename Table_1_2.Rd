\description{
Table_1_2 is a function to compute expected total error costs of risk difference tests given two equal groups,
at different alpha levels and at simultaneously multiple levels.
Output contains Table 1 and Table 2 of the paper. Details of the computations are in that paper
Prevalence of true findings is modelled using both zero-mean normal distributions and dichotomous distributions of effect sizes in the research environment
Word documents titled Table1 and Table2 are output into current directory.
}
\details{
Other variables
n= number of alphas
onetwo = ratio of Type I to Type II costs
true effect distribution variance in current computation
costs = vector of expected costs for sinle level tests, multilevel and optimal
R2 - true effect in treatment group in current calculation with dichotomous scenario
P - prevalence in current computation in dichotomous scenario
EM -  mean of effect distribution in current computation cts scenario
v -  sd of effect distribution in current computation cts scenario
CDiff = difference between costs at adjacent test levels in multi-level tests
(assuming costs are propertional to surprisal values)
minentry - vector of positions of lowest cost alphas for each scenario setting
row - row in Table
