\usage{
Table_3(
  alpha = c(0.25, 0.025),
  aa = c(-0.1, 0, 0.4),
  sig1 = 0.2,
  D = 0.4,
  sig2 = 0.1,
  cR = c(10, 4, 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alphas in decreasing order}

\item{aa}{vector of means of true effect size distributions}

\item{D}{mean of distrution of anticipated effect sizes}

\item{cR}{vector of cost ratios between Type I and Type II errors.}

\item{sd1}{standard deviation of true effect size distributions}

\item{sd2}{standard deviation of anticipated effect size distributions}
}
\description{
Table_3 is a function to compute averaged expected total error costs of superiority t-tests given two equal groups,
at different alpha levels and at simultaneously multiple levels.
The averages are over the distribution of anticipated standardized effect size of different research teams
in the research scenario, which is assumed to be normal.
Output contains Table 3 of the paper. Details of the computations are in that paper
Prevalence of true findings is modelled with normal distributions of standardized effect sizes in the research environment
Word document Table3 is output into current directory.

\details{
Other variables
n= group sample size (assuming equal groups)
a = current true distribution mean
cRatio = current Type I to Type II error cost ratio
CDiff = difference between costs at adjacent test levels in multi-level tests
(assuming costs are propertional to surprisal values)
minentry - vector of positions of lowest cost alphas for each scenario setting
